## Readme

This is a site where I will not only put some causeries up, but also archive any diaries, articles and ideas, although most of them are just scribbles. I just release it on purpose, with thinking of I need to leave a window to let others getting to know me in a non-passive but not aggressive fashion. Sorry to show you a git space with little projects and a mass of sentences don't make any sense.
